beyonce-player
==============

Play all of the videos from Beyoncé's new album "Beyoncé" that you bought on iTunes from Google Chrome.

##Setup
1. [Buy "BEYONCÉ" on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/beyonce/id780330041)
2. [Make sure you have Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
3. Download the zip of beyonce-player (or `git clone` if you fancy)
4. Double-click `run.command`
5. Use your Chromecast to watch BEYONCÉ... and bow down, bitches.

For those who care, it's gonna make a symlink to the files in your iTunes and use HTML5 `<video>` to play the thing. arrow buttons control volume and which video you're one, and space bar works for play-pause.
